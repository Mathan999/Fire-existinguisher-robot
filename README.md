# üî• Fire Extinguisher Robot using STM32 (STM32CubeIDE)

This project is a simple yet effective fire-fighting robot built using an STM32F446RE microcontroller. The robot can detect fire using an IR flame sensor, move toward the fire, and automatically extinguish it using a water pump controlled via a relay and servo motor.

## üßæ Project Overview

The Fire Extinguisher Robot is designed to detect fire using flame sensors and autonomously move toward the source of the fire. Once the fire is close enough, it activates a water spraying mechanism using a servo motor and a water pump to extinguish the flame.

The project is programmed using **STM32CubeIDE**, and runs on an **STM32F446RE** development board.
